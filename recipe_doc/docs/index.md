RECIPE is a framework based on a grammar-based genetic programming algorithm that builds customized classification pipelines. 

The framework is flexible enough to receive different grammars and can be easily extended to other machine learning tasks. It overcomes the drawbacks of previous evolutionary-based frameworks, such as generating invalid individuals, and organizes a high number of possible suitable data pre-processing and classification methods into a grammar.
